# Breakout2D
Personal project to learn JavaScript and game development
==============================================================
Created this game with MDN's Phaser Development Tutorials.

This game is a basic version of the classic breakout game; move the mouse to play.

Made major improvements to the original game:
  -stopped paddle from teleporting to the centre when it touches the left wall
  -stopped the padding from moving after the ball leaves the game zone
  -replaced "game over" and "game won" alerts to a text based prompt
  -increased the difficult of the game by increasing the balls velocity after hitting a brick
  -increased the balls initial velocity from 150,-150 to 250,-250
  -removed the twine and wobble features...
