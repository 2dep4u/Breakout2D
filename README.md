# Breakout2D
Personal project to learn JavaScript and game development.

Created this game with MDN's Phaser Development Tutorials.

This game is a basic version of the classic breakout game; move the mouse to play.

Made major improvements to the original game:
<ul>
  <li>stopped paddle from teleporting to the centre when it touches the left wall
  <li>stopped the padding from moving after the ball leaves the game zone
  <li>replaced "game over" and "game won" alerts to a text based prompt
  <li>increased the difficult of the game by increasing the balls velocity after hitting a brick
  <li>increased the balls initial velocity from 150,-150 to 250,-250
  <li>removed the twine and wobble features... 
</ul>
